First of all Collected the Data 'Flaship 2020-22' from various Sources such as Gadget360, GSMArena, 91mobiles then done feature engineering on that data 
using python in Google.Colab using some plotting and functions, found the highly correlated features of devices with the price. And then made ML model to 
predict the Price. After creating the ML Model using Voting Regressor exported the Model and data using Pickle Library and added the files in Pycharm to 
form an open web page using package called streamlit. After designed and created the web page I made a survey using Google Form to find out the most 
relevent features that a user need in Flagship devices. After getting enough records for survey I made a code in Python to findout the countplots for each 
features mentioned in survey. In this project I have to find out the best Gaming and Non-gaming flagship devices so, after finding most selected features 
for each category, I put those features in the web page, that created earlier, and change the name of brand each time and predict the price of each brand 
with the ideal features that I found. After getting the price details of all the ideal devices, compared it with the existing products using Tableau. From 
that I did find products which have more than 60% features that are comparable to the predicted ideal devices. Finally made an interactive DashBoard on 
Tableau for those Selected Best Flagship devices in both category.
